      I'm a <span class="inf-override">developer</span> with a strong foundation in both frontend
      and backend development.

    <h3 class="tert-override">What is my <span class="prim-override">skillset</span>?</h3>
    <p class="surface-w-border max-p-90">
      On the frontend, I specialize in <span class="inf-override">Vue3</span> with
      <span class="inf-override">TypeScript </span> and/or
      <span class="inf-override">JavaScript</span>, building clean and maintainable user interfaces.
      For client backend development, my goto languages are
      <span class="inf-override">Python</span>, and <span class="inf-override">Go</span> to develop
      reliable APIs and performant systems.
    </p>
    <p class="surface-w-border max-p-90">
      I also have experience with lower-level development using the
      <span class="inf-override">C/C++</span> programming languages; In which I have extensively
      used the cross platform multimedia library <span class="inf-override">SDL2</span> and the
      <span class="inf-override">OpenGL</span> API specification, which has strengthened my
      understanding of system-level programming and graphics.
