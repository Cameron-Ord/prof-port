        I'm a <span class="inf-override">developer</span> with a strong foundation in both frontend
        and backend development.

      <h3 class="tert-override">What is my <span class="prim-override">skillset</span>?</h3>
      <p class="surface-w-border max-p-60">
        On the frontend, I specialize in <span class="inf-override">Vue3</span> with
        <span class="inf-override">TypeScript </span> and/or
        <span class="inf-override">JavaScript</span>, building clean and maintainable user
        interfaces. For client backend development, my goto languages are
        <span class="inf-override">Python</span>, and <span class="inf-override">Go</span> to
        develop reliable APIs and performant systems.
      </p>
      <p class="surface-w-border max-p-60">
        I also have experience with lower-level development using the
        <span class="inf-override">C/C++</span> programming languages; In which I have extensively
        used the cross platform multimedia library <span class="inf-override">SDL2</span> and the
        <span class="inf-override">OpenGL</span> API specification, which has strengthened my
        understanding of system-level programming and graphics.
